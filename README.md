## ‚öôÔ∏èInstallation 
To run a JAR file in the command prompt (CMD) with Java and JavaFX, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can check this by typing `java -version` in the CMD. If Java is not installed, please download and install it from the official Java website.

2. Ensure that you have the JavaFX library installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the OpenJFX website.

3. Open the command prompt (CMD) and navigate to the root folder where the JAR file and the required dependencies are located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if the JAR file is located in "C:\MyProject," you would type `cd C:\MyProject` in the CMD.

4. Once you are in the root folder, run the following command to execute the JAR file:

```
java -jar --module-path {JavaFX library path} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media GardenEscape.jar
```

Make sure to replace `{JavaFX library path}` with the actual path to the JavaFX library on your system. If you installed JavaFX in the default location, the path may be similar to `"C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-19\lib"`. Also, ensure that the JAR file is named correctly (in this example, it is named "GardenEscape.jar").

Here's an example command:

```
java -jar --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-19\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media GardenEscape.jar
```

By following these steps, you should be able to run the JAR file with the necessary JavaFX dependencies in the command prompt.
